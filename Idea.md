# Friday Night experiment idea! 

What are "mutual funds" -> A bucket of stocks, bonds etc, with different weightages, managed by a fund manager -> peopole pool money. 

Requires approvals license, SEBI etc etc.

But "Fundamentally" its just a bunch of stocks and invstments put together? 

I am going try and build my own "mutual funds" or what we call portfolio, but managed and suggested by my AI agents.

I am allowed to purchase stocks etc from my api my money, no approvals required. 

Yes there are still some benifits for funds, they get access to certain trades you cannot personally, they do have some bulk benifits which you dont

But still this is gonna be fun!

I am gonna give me agent some real money next month

I am not gonna give it random stats, but from my end, my philosphy on sectors and what kind of companies i belive in and why! 

The agent can access analyse data from growapp, internet, + news etc

Suggest and create bucket ideas for me, 
I can approve it will purchase th estocks on those weights to ensure the bucket

Then every day atleast once ( to start with ) i will run the agent to keep track, if the bucket of stocks needs changfes reduce some by seeling and adding some more quantity of another stock, -> 

Goal short term -> beat FD returns by atleast 50% over 6 monhts
